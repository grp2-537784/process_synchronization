Two kinds of processes share a database. Readers execute transactions that examine 
database records; writer transactions both examine and update the database. The database is assumed initially to 
be in a consistent state (i.e., one in which relations between data are meaningful). Each transaction, if executed 
in isolation, transforms the database from one consistent state to another. To preclude interference between transactions, 
a writer process must have exclusive access to the database. Assuming no writer is accessing the database, any number of 
readers may concurrently execute transactions.

This problem is implemented in JAVA language, in this problem there is 4 main classes:
        
       1st class is barber- in this class Barber implements his work to customers and also calculated average time that
       how much time barber takes on 1 customer.
       
       2nd class is BarberShop- in this class it shows that how many chairs is available and how many are vacant among them
       and also show that how many customers are there in shop etc.

       3rd class is CustomerGenerator- in this class it shows that when the custumer arrives and leaves, how much time he
       takes for his haircut, etc.

       4th class is ProgressTracking- in this class it shows the total progress of the shop means how many customers came 
       to take haircut, how many customers are lost, whats the progress.


In this problems there is some threads also using wherever required..
